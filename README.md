This is a repository for my solutions to the problem sets in the [Intro to Computer Vision Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810) on Udacity. All code is written in Python and uses OpenCV.

### Author's Note
All credit for the course and problem sets go to the creators of the course and Udacity. With that said, the code posted here is my own creation and reflects my progress through the problem sets as I make my way through the course. This repository is _not_ meant to be an example of production code I would write; it simply serves as a place to continuously back up my progress through the course as I learn computer vision techniques and the OpenCV API.
